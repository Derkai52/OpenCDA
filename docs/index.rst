Welcome to OpenCDA's documentation!
===================================
OpenCDA is a **SIMULATION** tool integrated with a prototype cooperative driving automation (CDA; see SAE J3216) pipeline as
well as regular automated driving components (e.g., perception, localization, planning, control). The tool integrates automated driving simulation (CARLA), traffic simulation (SUMO), and Co-simulation (CARLA + SUMO).
OpenCDA builds upon standard automated driving system (ADS) platforms and focuses on various classes of data exchanges and cooperation between vehicles, infrastructure, and other road users (e.g., pedestrians).

OpenCDA is **all in Python**. The purpose is to enable researchers to fast-prototype, simulate, and test CDA algorithms and functions.  By applying our simulation tool, users can conveniently conduct both task-specific evaluation (e.g. object detection accuracy) and pipeline-level assessment (e.g. traffic safety) on their customized algorithms.

In collaboration with `U.S.DOT CDA Research <https://its.dot.gov/cda/>`_ and the `FHWA CARMA Program <https://highways.dot.gov/research/operations/CARMA>`_, OpenCDA, as an open-source project, makes a unique contribution from the perspective of initial-stage development and testing using simulation. OpenCDA is designed and built to support **initial algorithmic testing** for CDA Features. Through collaboration with CARMA Collaborative, this tool provides a unique capability to the CDA research community and will interface with the `CARMA XiL tools <https://github.com/usdot-fhwa-stol/carma-simulation>`_ being developed by U.S.DOT to support more advanced simulation testing of CDA Features.

OpenCDA is a work in progress. Many features on the roadmap are being continuously developed. We welcome your contribution and please visit our Github repo
for the latest release.
